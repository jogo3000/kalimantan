* Kalimantan
Kalimantan is an experiment to see how much of Clojure inspired
functional programming can be implemented in pure Java. I'm trying to
find out what aspects come from the Java language itself and what is a
result of the standard Java libraries.
** Why "Kalimantan"?
Java is an island in Indonesia. Kalimantan is another island in
Indonesia. Kalimantan (the library) can be seen as an alternate
reality version of Java standard library.
